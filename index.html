            <h4>The Core Thought Of Web Developer</h4>
            <P>“Your website is the center of your digital eco-system, like a brick and mortar location, the
                experience matters once a customer enters, just as much as the perception they have of you before they
                walk
                through the door.”</P>

            <h2>Dream BIG</h2>
            <h3>Become A Developer</h3>
            <p>As a young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my interests changed,
                my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one
                occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately pursue.
